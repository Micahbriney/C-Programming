This program will act as a filter, removing adjacent duplicate lines 
as it copies its stdin to its stdout. That is, any line that is identical
to the previous line will be discarded rather than copied to stdout.

There are no imposed limits on file size or line length.

read long line(FILE *file) will read an arbitrarily long line 
from the given file into newly-allocated space.

The makefile has built in testcases.
