make will build program.

The program is incomplete. I was able to (I think) fork all the necessary
children for each pipe/stage. I implemented pipe clean up but it still needs
to be tested. I don't think the program is execing correctly still needs 
testing for that also. Interrupt signal doesn't seem to be working as expected
since it takes a while for the child processed to close.

Also I am using the local library as that is what I was using during development
and now that I am trying to build the file on the unix server its not compiling correctly
something in the makefile perhaps. So i reverted back to using local stuff.
