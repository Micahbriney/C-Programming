Just build with "Make"
You can also test with "make test"

Valgrind is telling me there are loads of "Invalid read of size 1" issues. I
managed to fix about 150 of them by checking that size > 0 when doing strncpy.
Still unsure why there are so many issues. Maybe because I am zeroing out
the array that is passed to it?
