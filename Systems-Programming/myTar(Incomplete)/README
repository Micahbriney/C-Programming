The program can compile and run but the status is incomplete.
I almost had a fully functioning create mode. I was able to parse out all
of the data but it still needs to be padded before being written to the 
archive. The only ustar info left to get was the checksum value. Also 
the data blocks function has not been implemented yet. 

Extraction and table of contents have not been implemented yet.

Option contol is included and has been tested. The Make file includes 37
or so tests for the options.
