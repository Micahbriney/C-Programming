The tinyFs works pretty well. There is still a lot of testing that
needs to happen. As well as code clean up. There are a lot of commented out
code.

Some additional functionality are time stamp updates and file consistency checks.
There are required magic numbers saved to the "disk" to be able to mount it. 
There are checks between the file system variable to make sure nothing gets
out of sync.
The Free blocks are slightly imlemented using a doublly linked list. Allocating
free blocks as inode blocks and data blocks works fine. I ran out of time for
implementing writting data to them.
